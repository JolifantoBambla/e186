# e186[Library]

A real-time rendering framework for:
* OpenGL 4
* C++17

Environment for which the project is preconfigured:
* Windows 10, 64bit (make sure to have an SDK installed)
* Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition is fine)
* There's a Linux port at [github.com/lemurni/Engine186-Linux](https://github.com/lemurni/Engine186-Linux) (It's a bit out of date, though)

Setup:
* Clone the repository 
* Open the solution file [visual_studio/e186_framework_and_example.sln](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/e186/tree/master/visual_studio/e186_framework_and_example.sln) with Visual Studio 2019
* Build and run (Make sure that _"example"_ is selected as the start-up project; _"e186"_ is the library project which contains the framework)

# Example Code

The example project located at [visual_studio/example](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/e186/tree/master/visual_studio/example) and it's single implementation file [visual_studio/example/main.cpp](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/e186/blob/master/visual_studio/example/main.cpp) may serve as a starting point. Implementation-wise, _e186_ is organized into scenes, two of which can be found at:
* [src/ModelExplorerScene.cpp](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/e186/blob/master/src/ModelExplorerScene.cpp) ... a scene which loads a model and renders it.
* [src/SampleSceneTessIco.cpp](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/e186/blob/master/src/SampleSceneTessIco.cpp) ... a scene wich loads a icosahedron model and renders it using tessellation shaders.      
Please refer to these scene implementation files in order to learn how to use _e186_.
